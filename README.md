lootGenerator
=============

Random loot parcel generator for D&amp;D 4E

So the general idea is that this web tool will output ten loot parcels based on the level of the player party 
and their races, classes, preferred weapons, and preferred armors. 

The plan is to set up a database with all the magical properties as well as specific magical items and pull 
data from that. 

So the basic structure will be:
  HTML for interaction and front end
  Javascript for form submission and dynamic display
  PHP for accessing the database and returning data
  MySQL for storing magical item information
  
Unfortunately, there's no ownership here and no APIs allowed. This could be difficult and time consuming.
BUT HOPEFULLY WORTH IT! :D
